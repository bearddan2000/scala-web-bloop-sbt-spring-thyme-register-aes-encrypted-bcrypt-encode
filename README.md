# scala-web-bloop-sbt-spring-thyme-register-aes-encrypted-bcrypt-encode

## Description
A springboot secure web app with thymeleaf support.
Three roles are defined; USER, ADMIN, and SUPER. All roles
can access pages `/home`, `/login`, and `/about`. Only USER
can access `/user` and ADMIN only `/admin` whereas SUPER can
navigate to either and have its own `/super`. Each role
has an action USER=VIEW ONLY, ADMIN=READ/WRITE, SUPER=CREATE.
All password are encrypted with AES and encoded with bcrypt
to insure strong passwords.

Presents a register form to create an inMemoryUser.
Once the user is created it is given the `USER` role
by default and auto logged in.
